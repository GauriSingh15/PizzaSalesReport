Pizza Sales Report using PowerBI
# Introduction
I came across the dataset online and I practice my skills of data cleaning,analysis and visualization.

# Problem Statement




# Data Sourcing
I downloaded the excel workbook, and extracted it into PowerBI for cleaning, analysis and visualization.
It contains one table.
# Data Transformation/Cleaning
Data was efficiently cleaned and transformed using with the power query editor of PowerBI. 
Some of the applied steps includes:

->Replaced value from L to Large , M to Medium, etc.

->Inserted new column Day Name, which is extracted from date column

->Added Conditional Column to the table to assign numeric value to week days.

->Inserted new column Month name, extracted from date column.
